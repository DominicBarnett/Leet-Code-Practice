Coding Interview Prep: Arrays, Hashing, Two Pointers, and Stack

Overview

This project documents my progress in preparing for coding interviews by practicing problems from the NeetCode Practice list. Iâ€™ll be focusing on foundational problem-solving techniques for Arrays, Hashing, Two Pointers, and Stacks. This README serves as a tracker and guide for the problems tackled, insights gained, and strategies applied.

Problem List

Arrays and Hashing

Problem 1: https://neetcode.io/problems/duplicate-integer

  Key Concepts:

  Array traversal

  Hash maps for efficient lookups

  Approach:

  Identify patterns in data.
  
  Use a hash map to optimize operations like lookups or counting occurrences.

  Outcome: (Will update after solving)

Problem 2: https://neetcode.io/problems/is-anagram

  Key Concepts:

    Frequency counting

    Efficient duplicate detection

  Approach:

    Traverse the array and build frequency maps.

    Identify constraints for early exits.

  Outcome: (Will update after solving)

Problem 3: https://neetcode.io/problems/two-integer-sum

  Key Concepts:

    Sliding window techniques

    Hashing for dynamic updates

  Approach:

    Define window boundaries.

    Use hash maps to manage the sliding window efficiently.

Outcome: (Will update after solving)

Two Pointers

Problem 1: https://neetcode.io/problems/is-palindrome

  Key Concepts:

    Two-pointer traversal

    In-place array modifications

  Approach:

    Initialize pointers at relevant positions.

    Move pointers based on conditions to avoid extra space usage.

Outcome: (Will update after solving)

Stack

Problem 1: https://neetcode.io/problems/validate-parentheses

  Key Concepts:

    Stack operations (push, pop, peek)
  
    Matching elements (e.g., parentheses validation)

  Approach:

    Use stack to track relevant elements.

    Apply conditions to determine valid or invalid states.

  Outcome: (Will update after solving)
